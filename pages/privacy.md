**In short:** Chronicle Epilogue does not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data to external servers. All data remains on your device and your personal Plex Media Server.

## Information We Collect

## Information Stored Locally

All app data is stored locally on your device. This includes:

- **Audiobook Progress:** Your playback position, bookmarks, and listening history
- **User Preferences:** App settings, playback speed, sleep timer configurations, and theme preferences
- **Downloaded Content:** Audiobooks you download for offline listening are stored in your device's local storage

This locally stored data:

**Important Notes:**
- Your Plex server is controlled entirely by you

- For details on how Plex handles authentication, please refer to [Plex's Privacy Policy](https://www.plex.tv/about/privacy-legal/)

## Data Security

- Authentication tokens are stored securely on your device
- All communication with Plex servers uses industry-standard encryption
- We follow Android security best practices for local data storage
