# Support Chronicle Epilogue

Chronicle Epilogue started as a passion project—built to make enjoying audiobooks through Plex simpler, smoother, and more enjoyable. It’s grown thanks to a community of listeners who care about open tools, thoughtful design, and owning their media.
If you’ve found value in the app, thank you.

## Free & Open Source Forever

Chronicle Epilogue is — and always will be — **free and open source software**.  

There are no ads, no tracking, and no paid features hidden behind a paywall—just a focus on building a great audiobook experience.

## Support Continued Development

Building and maintaining Chronicle Epilogue takes time: designing features, fixing bugs, keeping up with Android changes, and responding to community feedback.

If you’re enjoying the app and would like to support its continued development, sponsorship is a great way to do so.
